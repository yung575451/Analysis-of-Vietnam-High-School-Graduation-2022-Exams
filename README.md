## Dataset
We used two datasets for our research:

* **StudentGrade_2022**: This dataset contains approximately 1 million rows of data and serves as the primary dataset for our analysis and exploration.

* **Cities_Infomation**: The dataset used in our research contains the predicted population of Vietnam in 2022, derived from historical values such as 1999, 2009, and 2019. Additionally, it includes rankings that reflect the modernization level of cities, with tier 1 cities like Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City considered highly developed. The dataset also provides latitude and longitude coordinates for each city, enabling us to plot them on a world map for improved visualization.
